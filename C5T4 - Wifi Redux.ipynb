    "When I did this in R I came up with some unique methods that ended up not working very well.  With Python, I want to try similar methods, but a different top down approach - to start, I want to try predicting building, then floor, then space, then position instead of predicting all 4 directly.  I am also mulling predicting Longitude/Latitude instead, and then using the results for that to predict the unique space.\n",
    "One good thing about this nested way of predicting is that we can try different methods at the different levels.  We might have 2 or 3 methods to predict building, and then move forward with the best."
